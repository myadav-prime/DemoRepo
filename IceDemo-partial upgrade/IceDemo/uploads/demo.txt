The EMR will be known as SupraMed.&nbsp;
</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>SupraMed will contain a medical record for each patient, the
specifics of which will be detailed later in this document.&nbsp; The EMR will be architected so that later
versions (outside the scope of this SOW) will be able to capture not only text
based notes, but also interactive pictures that allow the doctor to annotate
areas on the image which are to be the focus of procedures. The EMR will also
be architected so that a mobile version of the application can be added
to the application suite, although the actual mobile application is outside the
scope of this statement of work.&nbsp; </span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The application will be cloud based and will be
sold on a subscription basis to other plastic surgery practices.&nbsp; The specific platform for hosting the
solution will be determined during Sprint&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="color:rgb(224,102,102);"></span>
